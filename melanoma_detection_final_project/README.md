# Malignant Melanoma Detection Using Deep Learning

Final project for a Data Science course focused on training a deep learning model
to classify skin lesion images as malignant melanoma or benign.

The model was built using the EfficientNet architecture with transfer learning,
achieving ~95% classification accuracy, and deployed via Streamlit for accessible
melanoma detection.
