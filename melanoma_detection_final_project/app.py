    **Welcome to the Melanoma Detection App!** A tool designed to assist in assessing skin spots for potential melanoma.
    
    The primary goal of this app is to raise awareness about melanoma and emphasize the importance of routine examinations by a dermatologist.
    Early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment and improved outcomes.
    
    - ðŸ’¡ While this app provides valuable insights, it's important to note that **it does not replace professional medical advice.**
    - ðŸ“… Remember to schedule regular visits with a dermatologist for comprehensive skin examinations.
    

    **How to Use:**
    1. **Capture a Close-Up Photo:** Take a clear, close-up image of the suspicious skin spot. Ensure that the spot is well-focused and visible within the frame.
    2. **Upload the Photo:** Use the upload feature to submit the captured image to the app.
    3. **Receive Prediction:** Our model will analyze the uploaded image and estimate the likelihood of the spot being malignant or benign.
